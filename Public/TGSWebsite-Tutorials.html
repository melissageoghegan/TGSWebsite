                    <dd class="tdesc">The first thing you want to do, is make sure you have your yarn ready. Think about the kind of project you want to make. Different yarn is suited to different projects. For example, if you are planning on making a blanket or jumper for a baby, you might want to consider buying and extra soft yarn that is also on the thinner side.</dd>
                    <dd class="tdesc">Once you have selected your yarn, the next thing you want to do is select your crochet hook. There are a large variety of sizes. If you are unsure of what size to use, the outer paper wrapping around your yarn will give you the suggested size for crochet hooks and knitting needles. If your yarn did not provide those suggestions or you no longer have access to the wrapping, the next best thing to do is put your yarn in the little groove of the hook. If the yarn fits well in the groove, then you've got the correct size. If it's too loose, then you need a smaller size. If it doesn't fit well, then you need a larger size.</dd>
