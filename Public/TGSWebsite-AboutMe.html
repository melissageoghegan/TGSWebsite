            <p>Hi everyone! My name is Melissa Geoghegan.
            </p> 
            <p>I've been crocheting since I was about 8 years old. I gained an interest in crocheting after seeing my grandmother crochet and knit. I has always been fasicnating to me how we can turn yarn into things like clothes, accesories, plushies, and so many other possibilites. I went on to looking up videos and tutorials online to learn more. I would look up tutorials and them have to look up another tutorial to learn how to do a certain stitch.
            </p>
            <p>
            The amount of different stitches is yet another thing I love about crocheting.
